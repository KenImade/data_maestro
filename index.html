        <h3>What I do</h3>
        <h4>Data Analytics</h4>
        <p>
          I apply advanced analytical techniques to extract valuable insights from complex data sets, 
          helping businesses optimize operations, forecast trends, and make data-driven decisions. 
          My approach combines statistical analysis, data visualization, and predictive modeling 
          to uncover the stories behind the numbers.
        </p>

        <h4>Data Engineering</h4>
        <p>
          Building robust data pipelines and scalable architectures is key to efficient data management. 
          I specialize in designing, developing, and maintaining systems that ensure data is collected, 
          processed, and delivered seamlessly, enabling teams to work with reliable, clean data.
        </p>

        <h4>Machine Learning and AI</h4>
        <p>
          From regression models to deep learning, I work with cutting-edge machine learning algorithms to 
          solve real-world problems. Whether predicting customer behavior or automating processes, 
          my ML models aim to add tangible value.
